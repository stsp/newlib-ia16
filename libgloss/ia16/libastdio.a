 * This "library" (linker script) is used by the -mnewlib-autofloat-stdio
 * option of ia16-elf-gcc to alter the link process when using the
 * "ordinary" formatted I/O routines, so that it links against the integer
 * versions of the stdio routines (iprintf (...) etc.) if the user's program
 * does not use floating-point stdio functionality.
 *
 * The script uses an extension to the ld scripting language I introduced to
 * allow modules to be included conditionally.  -- tkchia
